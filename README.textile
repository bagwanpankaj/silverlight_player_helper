This will automatically do what is required by JW Silverlight Player.

If required files are not copied autometically under public directory then run 

@rake sl_player:install@

First you need to include two javascript files into your views

@<%= javascript_include_tag 'silverlight', 'wmvplayer' %>@

then In your views use it like

@<%= silverlight_player({:file => '/path/video.wmv',:width => 640, :height => 480}) %>@
